The theme for issue 1 is “Faggot Dinosaur.” I hope to hear from you! Thank you and best wishes.                                                                                            —Ali, editor, Artists among Artists   I think that I shall never fear a brontosaurus that is queer,  iguanodon as fetisheer, a mammoth bringing up the rear, an astrodon with extra gear,  metrosexual squirrel and deer, a breeder with a dance career, a fruit with cauliflower ear,  a lesbianic Chanticleer, a grinning limpish-wristed Lear, the weird one or the mutineer,  but those who perfectly adhere, stay clear, stay clear, stay clear, stay clear."
